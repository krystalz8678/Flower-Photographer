      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello, I am Krystal! I specialize in taking pictures of flowers! With a year of experience I can help take any types of photos related to flowers! My journey started last year and it has been a fun experience. My family and friends have been a huge supporter of mine since the beginning, so a wish of mine is to make them proud. </p>
      <p>Although I do not have a lot of experience, many of my previous clients have been satisfied with my results! I take great care in the details and will gladly listen to the inputs of my clients.  Please take a look at what some of my clients are saying down below, or check out my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a>! </p>
